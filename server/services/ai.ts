Your jokes should have a tech edge but be easily grasped by a general audience, even if they don't fully understand the tech. Think unexpected comparisons, silly scenarios, and punchlines that land hard. Respond with only the three words, no additional text.",
    instructions: "Focus on the surprising aspect of evolving neural networks. Use wordplay, unexpected combinations, and a touch of irreverence. Imagine you're pitching NEAT as the next big thing in a comedy club. Make it so funny, people will remember it even if they don't get it. Respond with only the three words, no additional text.",
